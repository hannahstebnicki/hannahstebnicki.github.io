                                <h2 class="jsx-2595255163">Some Call Them A Product Owner. I Call Them Visionary.</h2>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">The purpose of this blog post is to delve a little into the role and traits of a product owner. Curious? Keep reading :)</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">Product owners are major stakeholders for tech companies - they have to wear many hats and foster many skills to be successful in their role. Ideally, they are the ones that set the vision for a product, are attuned to the needs of the customers, and they are aware of the resources available for the products&#x27; successful release.</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">Amongst many responsibilities, one of the greatest tasks for a product owner is to be in charge of the product backlog. The product backlog is the compilation of different requirements that lead to the release of a product. Rather than delegating the tasks for each requirement one by one to team members, the product owner makes sure that the backlog is consistently updated and ordered accordingly to business needs, release dates, and importance. So, what is the backlog composed of? The backlog is composed of user stories.</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">User stories are requirements for a given product. These stories are a result of many hours of research and conversations, collaboration with stakeholders, and business needs. To write successful user stories a PO needs to understand the needs of the customer and has to embrace an empathetic attitude and genuine interest in the users. They have to place themselves in the user&#x27;s shoes to see what wants and needs should be fulfilled by the product at hand.</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">To understand this process a little more let’s say there’s a product that helps restaurant owners build menus and other print outs for their business. If I was a restaurant owner I would most likely be more preoccupied with managing my restaurant and promoting my business then wanting to know how to code or use graphical software to build my website, therefore I would like a really easy and time-effective way to build my menus. So a quick tutorial video might be just the thing to make me more familiar with the menu building software. Quick and easy so I can get back to my restaurant!</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">I could write a user story saying - “As a restaurant owner, I want to know how to build a pamphlet so that I don&#x27;t have to waste time on figuring it out on my own.”</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">The technical format for user stories is &quot;As a [ type of user ], I want [ some goal ] so that [ some reason ].&quot;</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">The user stories don’t have to be too long, but they definitely have to be easy to understand so developers can focus on figuring out how to execute the story and not on what the story actually means.</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">Additionally, while being in charge of the product backlog you are also a leader with a vision! Some of the most successful product owners are leaders with the ability to influence the team with the vision for the product ( side note: they are not a drill sergeant ). As a leader, you need to live and breath the purpose of the product!</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">Another vital component of a product owner&#x27;s role is being attuned to the business and its product. So knowing the budget, events that are happening, or anything that might affect the release of the product. Therefore, it is imperative to stay connected with other departments and embrace curiosity so that nothing comes as a surprise. Being attuned with how the business is doing and what struggles it may be facing results in a more cohesive environment for all stakeholders in the product. Learning to leverage information from the business analysts, financial managers, or anyone who has any potential stake in the result of the product is key. This leads us to another skill that is vital to the role of a product owner.</p>
                                <p class="jsx-2595255163">Communication. Being able to have good connections with as many departments of the business as possible helps with transparency and the flow of shared meaning amongst people. Since most products require multiple team members and stakeholders for the successful release it is imperative to know how to stay on good terms with everyone. There will definitely be conflicts and arguments - that’s just part of being human, but as long as there is a common vision and shared values it will be more manageable to kill the fires before/when they start.</p><h4 class="jsx-2595255163">Disclaimer:</h4><p class="jsx-2595255163">The purpose of this post was to learn the basics of what the role of a product owner consists of. There is a lot more to the role of the product owner than described in this post, additionally, the role can vary from organization to organization. Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin to chat about your experience - I am always eager to learn :)</p><ul class="jsx-2595255163 list-unstyled">
